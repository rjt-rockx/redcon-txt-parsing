Autocannon Defense Turret 
Fills the skies with bullets, shooting down incoming aircraft and ordnance.
Reliable against airships, projectiles in direct line of fire and missiles.
Benefits greatly from the target tracking provided by Laser Defense System. 

Flak Defense Tower
Fires a cluster of burning, proximity fuze triggered airburst bomblets. Resulting aerial explosions are effective against heavy projectiles and multiple shells incoming at once.
Flak does not need additional power to operate, however its ammunition consumption is comparable to that of a medium-sized artillery. 

Laser Defense System
Laser beam targets incoming ordnance with 100% precision, tracking and rapidly heating the payload until it explodes.
Effective against light shells and missiles.
Nearby Flak and Autocannon defense turrets increase their effectiveness against tracked targets by +30%
